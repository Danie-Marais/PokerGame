POKER GAME
For this program, you will be taking a text input of playing cards and evaluating the best
poker hand that could be constructed with the cards.
For example, given a string input of:
'AS, 10C, 10H, 3D, 3S'
(the cards above are ace of spades, 10 of clubs, 10 of hearts, 3 of diamonds and 3 of spades)
Output would be: 'Two Pair'
Use whatever language you are most comfortable in, preferably Python/PHP if you are
familiar with it.
We are looking for evidence of good:
- Object Oriented programming
- Design Principles
- Separation Of Concerns
- Testing Methodologies
rather than language skills.
The objective is not to implement everything, but we are interested in seeing how you
prioritize features. For us to see that progress, please provide a git commit history. We also
recommend using API to determine the strength of a particular hand.
For reference, the ten possible poker hands can be found at:
